## by Mencius Moldbug

 - loc 78 - I’d say a fair definition of an Orwellian government is one whose principle of public legitimacy (Mosca’s political formula, if you care) is contradicted by an accurate perception of reality.​ In other words, the government is existentially dependent on systematic public deception.​

 - loc 138 - There are two kinds of government: those whose formula of legitimacy depends on popular consent, and those whose doesn’t.​ Following contemporary usage, we can classify these as authoritarian and democratic.

 - loc 160 - The root problem with a state church in a democratic state is that, to believe in democracy, one must believe that the levers of power terminate with the voters.​ But if your democracy has an effective state church, the actual

 - loc 160 - The root problem with a state church in a democratic state is that, to believe in democracy, one must believe that the levers of power terminate with the voters.​ But if your democracy has an effective state church, the actual levers of power pass through the voters, and go back to the church.​

 - loc 211 - Professional intellectuals and intelligentsia comprised a collective interest.​ They were the great unexamined class in modern political history, whose will to power occasionally took the form of revolutionary ideological politics.​

 - loc 230 - Unlike the Harvard of 1639, the Harvard of 2009 bases its authority not on the interpretation of scripture, but on some other intellectually legitimating principle like reason or rationality.​ Everything else is the same.

 - loc 240 - Harvard is conventionally described as a “private” university.​ This term is strictly nominal.​ Vast streams of cash flow from the taxpayer’s pocket into Harvard’s—as they do not flow to, say, the Vatican.

 - loc 245 - Except for a few unimportant institutions of non-mainstream religious affiliation, we simply do not see multiple, divergent, competing schools of thought within the American university system.​ The whole vast archipelago, though evenly speckled with a salting of contrarians, displays no factional structure whatsoever.​ It seems almost perfectly synchronized.

 - loc 294 - public opinion of California in 2008 is quite similar to the public opinion of Stanford in 1963. This is easy to explain: in post-1945 America, the source of all new ideas is the university.​ Ideas check out of the university, but they hardly ever check in.​

 - loc 307 - But there is only one global postwar academic system, the American one, and all top-tier universities are in the United States.​ The con by which policies devised by this system are passed off as global, transcending mere nationality, is sometimes called transnationalism.​

 - loc 312 - Cthulhu may swim slowly.​ But he only swims left.​

 - loc 339 - First, we need to define left and right.​ In my opinion, obviously a controversial one, the explanation for this mysterious asymmetric dimension is easy: it is political entropy.​ Right represents peace, order and security; left represents war, anarchy and crime.

 - loc 343 - On the other hand, it is also quite easy to construct a very clean value system in which order is simply good, and chaos is simply evil.​ I have chosen this path.​

 - loc 343 - On the other hand, it is also quite easy to construct a very clean value system in which order is simply good, and chaos is simply evil.​ I have chosen this path.​ It leaves quite a capacious cavity in the back of my skull, and allows me to call myself a reactionary.​ To you, perhaps, it is the dark side.​ But this is only because the treatment is not yet complete.

 - loc 357 - define power as personal influence over important events; I don’t know of any other definition.

 - loc 357 - status.​ I define power as personal influence over important events; I don’t know of any other definition.

 - loc 357 - I define power as personal influence over important events; I don’t know of any other definition.

 - loc 370 - The left is chaos and anarchy, and the more anarchy you have, the more power there is to go around.​ The more orderly a system is, the fewer people get to issue orders.​ The same asymmetry is why corporations and the military, whose system of hierarchical executive authority is inherently orderly, cluster to the right.

 - loc 385 - on the case, deploying the old principle of “this animal is very dangerous; when attacked, it defends itself.”6 The progressive is always the underdog in his own mind.​ Yet, in objective reality, he always seems to win in the end.

 - loc 385 - The least exception or (God forbid) reversal, and Chomsky is in on the case, deploying the old principle of “this animal is very dangerous; when attacked, it defends itself.”6 The progressive is always the underdog in his own mind.​ Yet, in objective reality, he always seems to win in the end.

 - loc 399 - You see, the problem is not just that our present system of government—which might be described succinctly as an atheistic theocracy—is accidentally similar to Puritan Massachusetts.​ As anatomists put it, these structures are not just analogous.​ They are homologous.​ This architecture of government—theocracy secured through democratic means—is a single continuous thread in American history.

 - loc 495 - Thus we see the whole, awful picture merge together.​ It is Cthulhu.​ We don’t just live in something vaguely like a Puritan theocracy.​ We live in an actual, genuine, functioning if hardly healthy, 21st-century Puritan theocracy.

 - loc 855 - Evil is typically more powerful than good.​ Bad men delight in weapons that good men spurn.​ Success in past conflicts, political or military, is not Bayesian evidence of moral superiority.​ It is just the opposite.​ Which is why it’s a problem that the winners write the history books.

 - loc 1196 - The incentive of all federally-funded science is the same: keep your funding, and try to get more.​

 - loc 1199 - First: out of genuine curiosity, people started trying to build climate models, measure CO₂, and the like.​ Second: since USG is not a charity, they had to apply for grants and describe the importance of their work.​ Third: they noticed, consciously or subconsciously, that an easy way to make their work seem more important was to predict disastrous consequences.​ Fourth: the same evolutionary feedback process that, in a falsifiable science, eradicates error, operated to promote it.​ Researchers and fields which produced more alarming results received more funding—because, by definition, their work was more important.​ Iterate to the point of sheer insanity,

 - loc 1293 - Let’s say an orthodox economist is an economist who believes that any supply of money is adequate, and the money supply should be either fixed or bound to a commodity whose supply is very difficult to expand, such as gold.​ A new economist is a believer in an “elastic currency”: he believes that the amount of money in a country should expand as the country “grows.”​ Typically this involves a belief in paper money.

 - loc 1483 - But there is one thing to note: the common meaning of racism implies the belief that ancestry is significant information in the context of common decisions about individuals. It should be obvious that it is not.​ If you want to test a job applicant’s IQ, for example, give her an IQ test.​ Patterns of ancestry become useful only in decisions that affect large groups of humans in the aggregate.​ Governments, however, must often make such decisions. Therefore, if you are an HNU denialist and someone asks you whether you’re a racist, you can ask him if he implies the above belief, which we can call racial essentialism.​ (The Nazis, of course, were big essentialists.)​ If he says yes, tell him no.​ If he says no, you can tell him yes.

 - loc 1491 - example, consider the proposition that Jews tend to be better chess players than Negroes, whereas Negroes tend to be better dancers than Jews.​ Both halves of this statement may (or may not) be true, but neither can justify us in ranking the two races overall—unless our sole criterion of personal worth is either chess or dance.​

 - loc 1498 - so happens that, in the world of 2009, a talent for solving differential equations commands a higher salary and a larger job market than a talent for playing musical instruments.​ But there are exceptions: Prince is much better compensated than you.​ Does that make him a better person?​ Who could possibly care?​ We each are who we are, we each make the best of it.​ Duh.

 - loc 1501 - My ideal future is one in which governments pay at most minimal attention to race.​ If that makes me a racist, so be it.​

 - loc 1502 - Obviously, once you stop believing in democracy, it is easy to stop seeing the failure of this political design in societies with a high percentage of non-Eurasian genetic ancestry as a moral reflection on persons of non-Eurasian ancestry, and start seeing it as a mere engineering failure.​

 - loc 1628 - Americans failed to grasp the fundamentally predatory nature of the black-power movement.​ Rather than suppressing it forcefully and restoring the rule of law, the worse it behaved the more they fed it.​ The result was, and is, a Negro population which has essentially seceded from mainstream American culture, to the tremendous disadvantage of both parties.​ The resulting ghetto culture remains marinated with black-power ideology,

 - loc 1638 - Consider the discovery of unconscious racism.​ The involuntary, concealed, guilt-inducing activation of the European amygdala somehow seems to do just as good a job, if not better, as any Klan mob of keeping the black man down.​ We must get rid of the amygdala!​ Coincidentally—or not—this racist organ is also the part of the brain activated when you or I feel fear.​ I can’t imagine why that would be.

 - loc 1649 - The policy solution here is obvious: eliminate the race industry, abolish all racial privileges, including laws against “harassment” and “discrimination,” and restore unconditional freedom of speech and freedom of association.​ Someday, sooner or later, probably later, all this nonsense will end up in whatever dusty closet we sent the segregated water coolers to.​ Our government will finally forget about race and treat individuals as individuals

 - loc 1657 - The thing to note about these democratic feedback loops between public miseducation and official malpractice is their tremendous stability.​ As a believer in democracy, you expect the system to stabilize itself, the people to magically wake up, return to sanity, and seize control of their government.​ It is this dream from which you need to wake.​ It will never happen.

 - loc 1810 - Suppose, for example, that every dollar whose serial number is divisible by 2 was badly manufactured.​ One day, all these dollars disintegrate into green lint. Thus, everyone’s net dollar worth falls by 50%; spending craters; so does production; and we get, in short, exactly what we’re seeing now, with our 50% decline in financial-asset prices.

Now, how should a healthy government—a New Downing Street—react to this event?​ Option one: it can do nothing, allow consumption to fall, and let production stabilize at its new equilibrium.​ This is the liquidationist solution. If dollars were Fourth Empire sols (or gold),

 - loc 1828 - the Keynesian “stimulus.”​ The US can stimulate consumption by printing new money and spending it.​ For reasons that are essentially cosmetic, this is generally done by hiring people to do useless jobs—Keynes himself, for example, once suggested burying stacks of bills in abandoned mineshafts, then filling up the mines, to produce an equivalent of gold mining for fiat currency.​ Most of your “green jobs,” inasmuch as they produce nothing of any practical use to anyone, are of just this sort.

 - loc 2033 - The division of authority is simply the destruction of order.​ The Romans knew it as the political solecism of imperium in imperio, and Harvard Business School dreads it no less.​ There is no conceivable balance between competing authorities; they will fight until one kills the others, and even when they collaborate it is in the fashion of partners in crime.

 - loc 2040 - Democracy is a classic case of division of authority.​ It purports to dole out microscopic slivers of power equally to all subjects of the government.​ In fact this power is simply transferred to those who form, instruct, and organize large bodies of voters, whose average thoughts are unsophisticated by definition.​ Carlyle and others of his ilk called these men wire-pullers, and did not regard their growing importance as a good omen for the British polity.​ Surely the disaster of Great Britain in the democratic era evinces of some prescience in this regard. We must not be too harsh on the advocates of divided authority, however.​

 - loc 2097 - Honestly, I am happy just to stop believing in my government.​ The idea that, just because you are right and the State is wrong, you should be able to do something about it, is a nematode rather than a neuron.​ It is unique to the democratic era.​

 - loc 2243 - Acton was exactly wrong: it is not absolute, but partial power that corrupts.​ More precisely, it is partial authority not formally matched with partial responsibility.​ Formal shareholders experience no such conflict of interest—that is, their interests do not conflict with each others’, nor with the interests of the firm as a whole.​ And corruption depends on conflict of interest.

 - loc 2291 - The problem is that what we might call a pure democracy, a system in which actual power is distributed in exactly the same proportions that the democracy distributes nominal power, is so unstable and unlikely a proposition as to be ridiculous.​ If you doubt this, I recommend a tussle with Limits of Pure Democracy, by W. H. Mallock

 - loc 2398 - If we exclude the possibility of pure democracy, we see instantly that every democracy must be a psychological-warfare state.​ Most people get their opinions from others.​ If public opinion commands the power of the State, the power to inform is the power to command the State.​ Just as you will seldom find a stack of twenties on the sidewalk, this power will not just be waving around in the breeze.​ Someone will capture it, and hold it until it is torn from their hands.

 - loc 2429 - It cannot be stated with sufficient emphasis that information is one thing—propaganda quite another. The purpose of spreading information is to promote the functioning of man’s reason. The purpose of propaganda is to mobilize certain of man’s emotions in such a way that they will dominate his reason—not necessarily with evil design.

 - loc 2462 - Who informs the public?​ Journalists, schoolteachers, professors.​ Who tells schoolteachers what to say?​ Professors.​ Who tells journalists and professors what to say? No one.​ Au contraire—they are specifically immune from even the hint of any such authority.​ The trail of power disappears.​ The river goes underground.​
